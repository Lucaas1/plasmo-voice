### Alpha Notice
This version still requires testing, especially for backports.
If you encounter any issues, please report them on Discord: https://discord.gg/uueEqzwCJJ.

Versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x are protocol-compatible,
so thereâ€™s no need to worry if the server hasn't been updated to 2.1.x.

### Changes in 2.1.2
- Fixed buffer overflow when using AudioSender with delayed first frame.
- Fixed EncoderException on server switch on servers with proxy and proxy-side addons (e.g, groups addon).
