This version still requires testing, especially for backports.
If you encounter any issues, please report them on Discord: https://discord.gg/uueEqzwCJJ.

- New open source [Opus](https://github.com/plasmoapp/opus-jni-rust) and [RNNoise](https://github.com/plasmoapp/rnnoise-jni-rust) binaries, related to [#319](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice/issues/319) [#375](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice/issues/375) [#382](https://github.com/plasmoapp/plasmo-voice/issues/382).
